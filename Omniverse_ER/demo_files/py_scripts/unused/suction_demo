As of 7/17/24, I was not able to activate the pump with this script. Unsure what the issues is but could be something was not connected properly hardware wise or the demo code itself is deprecated. this code was found in the ER github under pymycobot/demo/myArm_demo/pump_test.py

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
# 引脚20/21分别控制电磁阀和泄气阀门
GPIO.setup(20, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(21, GPIO.OUT)

def pump_on():
    # 打开电磁阀
    GPIO.output(20, 0)


# 停止吸泵
def pump_off():
    # 关闭电磁阀
    GPIO.output(20, 1)
