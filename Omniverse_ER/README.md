Please refer to our [wiki page](https://github.com/uic-evl/digital-twin/wiki/Simple-Digital-Twin-in-Omniverse-and-Unreal-Engine-5) for a detailed guide on how to use the demo_files in this directory. 


The demo files include scripts and a ready to run scene to test the gripper in OVIS as a stand alone. In the wiki there are/will be instructions for adding additional end effectors as well.
