This is a sample scene that uses the Unity Robotics Hub URDF importer to import the Elephant Robotics Arm and control it through Isaac Sim. 

This project requires an Isaac Sim counterpart scene. You can find this on Spirit's Nucleus under `/Projects/Digital Twin/unity_connection/pos_from_unity.usd`
